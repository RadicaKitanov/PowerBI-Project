Data Model
Before proceeding with measure creation and report design, establish the data model. Utilize existing database diagrams to identify primary key (PK) and foreign key (FK) relations. For tables lacking relations, investigate the data to determine suitable columns for creating relations.

#### Design Considerations
Begin data analysis from the year 2012.
Select appropriate visualizations to effectively present data.
Include a Home page for navigation to all report pages.
Implement navigation buttons for easy navigation between pages.
Consider adding additional pages for visualizing supplementary information beneficial to the BI solution.
